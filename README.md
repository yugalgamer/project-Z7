### 🧩 What is Project-Z7?

**Project-Z7** is an **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** system that is designed to **think, learn, remember, and interact with the real world**.  
It’s not just a simple AI chatbot — it’s a **complete AI+Hardware system** that can:

- **Move** around like a robot using wheels.
- **See** the world through cameras and sensors.
- **Control other computers and systems** using a special USB connection.
- **Understand human commands and conversations**.
- **Remember important information** for personalized assistance.
- **Teach, assist, and help users** in different tasks.

Imagine an AI that can not only talk to you but also **control your computer**, **send messages**, **teach you new things**, and even **move in the real world** like a mini robot!
